Wind Power Prediction
Accurate prediction of wind power generation is complex due to stochastic components, but can play a significant role in minimizing operating costs, and improving reliability and security of a power system. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning model to accurately forecast the short term(60-min) wind power generation using the SOLETE dataset. The model consists of a Variational Mode decomposition (VMD) , Wavelets, convolutional neural network, Long short term memory (LSTM) layers and a fully connected neural network layer.
